In this project, I implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the presence or absence of Diabetes disease in patients based on a set of medical attributes. The dataset used for this project contains information about various health-related features that can influence the likelihood of diabetes disease. In addition, I worked on Django to make a user interface for users, where we can give the attributes as input, and with the help of a model it generates output either "Positive" or "Negative".
